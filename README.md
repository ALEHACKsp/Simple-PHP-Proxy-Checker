# Simple PHP Proxy Checker

Welcome to my simple PHP proxy checker that I use across my websites. This usually gets most proxies and I look forward in improving it to detect even more.
Please remember to add your email address to the $emailaddress variable in the beginning or the IPIntel check will not be ran. Thanks!
